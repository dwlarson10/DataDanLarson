## What is the summer of data science?

The summer of data science is the brain child of the [Data Science Renee](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci?lang=en) on twitter. Read her first two posts [here](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/05/28/summer-of-data-science-2018-sods18-launch-day/) and [here](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2018/06/06/summer-of-data-science-goal-setting/). For me, the summer of data science is an effort to focus on learning specific skills and to interact with the larger data science community. In this post, I will share my projects and learning plan for each one. As the summer progresses I hope to continue to post updates here and on twitter.

## My Summer Projects

I have four projects this summer. Two are to create specific products while the other two are skill building/learning focused.

1. Philadelphia Mural image classifier
2. Dissect Podcast artist analysis
3. Learn more about virtual environments and how to use them
4. Read [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0387848576/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0387848576&linkCode=am2&tag=sociall1-20&linkId=9c6be555ff204ae60dcbb120dbfd9502)

## Strategy to complete the projects

My main focus for this summer is to develop a few habits. First, start a coding habit where I regular work through programing challenges. Second, do more analysis focusing on more and more complex statistical techniques. Third, build good coding habits. Finally, I hope to increase my overall understanding of statistical techniques and principles. Here is how I hope to spend the next 10 weeks.

#### Project 1: Philadelphia mural image classifier

I have been talking about building a mural image classifier for some time. In the first couple weeks I plan to build a web scraping script that will download images from Instagram with the hashtag #PhillyMural. Once I have the script working. I will start learning how to build an image classifier to determine the identity of each mural. The end goal will be to create a database of geotagged murals throughout Philadelphia.

* week 1: explore python packages for Instagram API challenges
* week 2: set up python package and test functionality
* week 3: set up package to download images
* week 4: identify resources for image classifier



#### Project 2: Dissect Podcast artist analysis

One of my favorite podcasts is Dissect. A long format analysis of particular albums. So far the host has done three seasons, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and the current season Frank Ocean. I plan to do a series of analysis of these artists' music and lyrics. While these analysis will be fun, I also hope to use this project to explore various statistical analysis techniques. On a weekly basis I will share both short form exploratory analysis and insights on new statistical methodology.

* week 1: using the Spotify API extract data on all tracks by Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, and Frank Ocean.
* week 2: complete a exploratory analysis of the three artists.
* week 3: create data set of artist lyrics
* week 4: statistical analysis of the three artists and what makes them different from Spotify data set.

#### Project 3: Learn more about virtual environments and how to use them

This undertaking is to help me utilize best practices in programing/data science. In addition to understanding virtual environments for when I use python, I also plan to start using the project feature when working in R studio. Each week I will write about my own frustrations and epiphanies while trying to improve my basic techniques.

#### Project 4: Read Elements of Statistical Learning

I plan to read a chapter a week and work through the R examples on my own computer. The book is actually 18 chapters long so this goal might last a little into the fall. Each week I will share some of the knowledge I gain from this exercise.

I hope to approach mastery understanding of the following techniques

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Clustering
