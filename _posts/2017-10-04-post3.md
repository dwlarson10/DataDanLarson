Data
----

Following the incident in Charlottesville VA this summer, I wanted to know just how many confederate memorials there were. I reached out on Data for Democracy and found a report published by the SPLC. I then scraped the PDG and created a data set. I know it isn't complete, but it is a great start. I have published the data set on Data.World here: <https://data.world/datadanlarson/confederatemonument>

This post is a combination of where these memorials are located and a quick tutorial on how to use the tidyverse to analyze it.

Data.World
----------

First, let me give a shout out to data.world. If you are training to be a data scientist this is a great place to get and share data sets. There is an added bonus of getting to work with SQL to extract data.

Below is the sequence needed to extract data from data.world.

``` r
#Load the package
require(data.world)

# Setup your token
data.world::set_config(data.world::save_config(auth_token = "YOUR_DATA.WORLD_TOKEN))

#identify the data source
link <- "https://data.world/datadanlarson/confederatemonument"

#extract the data
confMon <- data.world::query(
  data.world::qry_sql("SELECT * FROM CivilWarMamorials"),
  dataset = link
)
```

Tibbles
-------

Once you have the data in memory, you can transform it to a tibble. A tibble is similar to a Dataframe but a little different. I recommend reading Data Science with R by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham if you want to know more. For know, just know that they allow for easy data pipping that we will be using shortly.

``` r
require(tidyverse)
as.tibble(confMon)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,528 x 6
    ##             state         city             nameofartifact
    ##             <chr>        <chr>                      <chr>
    ##  1        Alabama     Anniston Major John Pelham Monument
    ##  2        Alabama     Ashville       Confederate Monument
    ##  3        Alabama  Centreville       Confederate Monument
    ##  4        Alabama        Selma   Selma Navy Yard Memorial
    ##  5 South Carolina St. Matthews           “Lest We Forget”
    ##  6 South Carolina St. Matthews             Stonewall Lane
    ##  7 South Carolina  Summerville           Beauregard Court
    ##  8 South Carolina  Summerville            Stonewall Drive
    ##  9 South Carolina Timmonsville       Robert E. Lee Avenue
    ## 10 South Carolina Timmonsville            Stonewall Drive
    ## # ... with 1,518 more rows, and 3 more variables: type <chr>, year <chr>,
    ## #   civilwarstatus <chr>

Summarizing with tidyverse
--------------------------

The main benefit of using a tibble over a dataframe is the ease with which you can summaries your data. Without a tibble you may need to take multiple steps to subset, transform, and summarize your data. With a tibble you can do all of this with a singe chain of commands. In the code below, I am able to filter the data set to only monuments, create a table of counts by state and sort the table in only five rows of text. Additionally, I did not need to create a new dataframe.

``` r
as.tibble(confMon)%>% # Create the tibble
  group_by(state,civilwarstatus)%>% # Set the group by
  filter(type == 'Monument')%>%
  summarise(count = n())%>% # Determine how you want to summarise
  arrange(by=desc(count)) # Organize the data
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 3
    ## # Groups:   state [24]
    ##             state    civilwarstatus count
    ##             <chr>             <chr> <int>
    ##  1 North Carolina Confederate State    50
    ##  2        Georgia Confederate State    49
    ##  3       Virginia Confederate State    45
    ##  4       Kentucky      Border State    35
    ##  5 South Carolina Confederate State    34
    ##  6        Alabama Confederate State    31
    ##  7          Texas Confederate State    26
    ##  8      Louisiana Confederate State    23
    ##  9    Mississippi Confederate State    22
    ## 10       Arkansas Confederate State    21
    ## # ... with 14 more rows

First Visualization
-------------------

An additional benifit of using the tidyverse is that you can pipe in the ggplot2 commands. The tidyverse package allows you to do both data transformation and visualization within one string of commands. In the code below I have added the ggplot2 commands needed to create a bar chart. I want to point out that by using the tidyverse, I have been able to keep my code relatively clean and haven't needed to create any new dataframes.

``` r
as.tibble(confMon)%>%
  group_by(state,civilwarstatus)%>%
  summarise(count = n())%>%
  arrange(by=desc(count))%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(state,count),y=count,fill=civilwarstatus),stat = 'identity')+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Number of civil war monuments by state")
```

<p><img src="http://danlarson.io/static/img/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="Where are confederate monuments" /></p>


While the visual above gets the job done, it is always important to clean up your visuals for publication. Using ggplot2 allows the analyst to make all of the needed adjustments to background, the legend, and other various elements to brand your visuals.

Looking at the data we can see that there are some obvious patterns. First, the states with the most memorials are states that belonged to the confederacy. However, some boarder states have a number of memorials. As we will see in the map below, the majority of the memorials are in the south east of the country. However, there is are a surprising number in the North West.

``` r
as.tibble(confMon)%>%
  group_by(state,civilwarstatus)%>%
  summarise(count = n())%>%
  arrange(by=desc(count))%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x=reorder(state,count),y=count,fill=civilwarstatus),stat = 'identity')+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("Number of civil war monuments by state")+
  #set theme to black and white
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="#F0F0F0")) +
  theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill="#F0F0F0")) +
  theme(panel.border=element_rect(colour="#F0F0F0")) +
  # Format the grid
  theme(panel.grid.major=element_line(colour="#D0D0D0",size=.75)) +
  theme(axis.ticks=element_blank()) +
  # Dispose of the legend
  theme(plot.title=element_text(face="bold",hjust=0,vjust=2,colour="#3C3C3C",size=14)) +
  ylab("Number of memorials") +
  xlab("State") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=11,colour="#535353",face="bold")) +
  theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=11,colour="#535353",face="bold")) +
  theme(axis.title.y=element_text(size=11,colour="#535353",face="bold",vjust=1.5)) +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(size=11,colour="#535353",face="bold",vjust=-.5)) +
  # Plot margins and finally line annotations
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, .5, .7), "cm")) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

Mapping with the tidyverse
==========================

The visual above demonstrates that confederate memorials are consolidated into only portion of the states, it is nice to be able to visual see how these states might be related. The tidyverse also gives the R user the ability to build maps quickly and easily. To get started we do need to bring in the 'maps' package.

``` r
require(maps)

states <- map_data('state')

states_all <- data.frame(region=unique(states$region))
stateMon<-confMon%>%group_by(state)%>%summarise(count = n())%>% mutate(region=tolower(state))
stateMon <- left_join(states_all,stateMon,by='region')

ggplot()+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="#F0F0F0")) +
  theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill="#F0F0F0")) +
  theme(panel.border=element_rect(colour="#F0F0F0")) +
  # Format the grid
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())+
  # Dispose of the legend
  theme(plot.title=element_text(face="bold",hjust=0,vjust=2,colour="#3C3C3C",size=14))+
  geom_map(data=states, map=states,aes(x=long, y=lat, map_id=region),fill="#ffffff", color="#ffffff", size=0.15) +
  geom_map(data=stateMon,map=states,aes(fill=count,map_id = region),color="#ffffff", size=0.15) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low='lightblue', high='darkblue', guide='colorbar')+
  ggtitle("Number of Confederate Memorials per State")
```

Wrapping up
-----------

Using the tibbles, tidyr, dplr, and ggplot2 allow for very quick and easy manipulation of data. With fewer then ten lines of code you are up have visualizations without filling up your environment with unneeded objects. I am still new to using the tidyverse packages and using this space to learn more about how to use them efficiently. I will continue to explore this data set, adding new elements as I think of them, to try to understand how it is impacting our current culture.
