### Summer of Data Science

Well here we go again. I am setting a lofty goal for myself to increase the amount of coding I do this summer in an effort to improve my skills. Last summer I tried this and fell a little short. So obviously this year I am going to try and do more. Well more but maybe actually less. My goal this summer is to actual write code more often. I plan on doing this by completing more tidy Tuesday activities, participate in Kaggle competitions, and develop my python skills more.
