### Summer of Data Science

Well here we go again. I am setting a lofty goal for myself to increase the amount of coding I do this summer in an effort to improve my skills. Last summer I tried this and fell a little short. So obviously this year I am going to try and do more. Well more but maybe actually less. My goal this summer is to actual write code more often. I plan on doing this by completing more Tidy Tuesday activities, participate in Kaggle competitions, and develop my python skills more.

### Tidy Tuesday

[Tidy Tuesday]('https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday') is a community event around developing R visualizations and analysis on a data set that is released each Tuesday. Over the summer and into the fall I hope to develop visualizations and my techniques each week. Since I am just now getting started with this challenge there is plenty of data to go back and do additional practice on.

### Kaggle

A friend of mine told me that I need to get my reps in when it comes to models and data analysis.

There are plenty of great Kaggle evergreen data sets to get some practice on. My goal is to work through a few older competitions and then actual compete in at least two competitions over the summer.

### Python package

I just wrapped up a course on Data Science and preprocessing web data. The final project was to develop a data set. I worked on a grouped that hoped to develop a data set that would enable the analysis of stock data as it relates to twitter and news data. I hope to continue developing this package to eventually start working more on this data.


### 100 days of code

I lay all of this out in a hope that everyday I will spend a minimum of 1 hour writing code on at least one of these projects. I hope to post my progress here on this blog.
